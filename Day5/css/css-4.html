        consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and go through an ontogenetic 
        stage in which their body consists of a hollow sphere of cells,the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million
         living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 
         7 million animal species in total. <span class="m1" >animals</span> range in lengthfrom 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft).  
         They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study
          of <span class="m1" >animals</span> is known as zoology.
